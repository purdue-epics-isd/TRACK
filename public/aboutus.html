      <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> There! We are Track, a group of highly motivated students from Purdue University. We are all members of Purdue's Engineering
        Projects in Community Service (EPICS) Track team. TRACK started as an idea for teachers to track behaviors in class, specifically targeted at younger children. Because all teachers have an iPad, we thought about repurposing an old team’s iOS application and customizing it to fit the teacher’s needs. However, as we visited ISD early in the semester, it became clear that many other teachers at the school wanted the app as well, and that they would prefer the app as a web application. We thus pivoted to a web application with a focus on storing student data from year to year to help teachers understand their students more thoroughly.</br></br>
        ISD, the Indianapolis School for the Deaf, is a K-12 school for deaf children. There are about 62 teachers there that all track their students’ progress through Individualized Education Programs, or IEPs. Currently, teachers track the IEP goals of their students on either Excel spreadsheets or physically on clipboards during class. These general, overarching IEP goals are created once a year at a conference, but the goals for each individual student varies. There seems to be three main categories of IEP goals - behavior goals, like the number of times the students should do something, i.e. Bob answered the question correctly three out of five times this week; disciplinary “goals”, or easy ways for teachers to timestamp bad behaviors students do and notice patterns; finally, descriptive goals, which are open-ended notes that teachers will make of their students.</br></br>
        This app would be used by teachers, primarily on iPads, and would affect their interactions with the students they teach. The problem that currently happens is that it becomes difficult to teach, track, and timestamp behaviors students are exhibiting while class is in session. TRACK aims to address all three of these issues with an easy to use iPad application. The main goal that TRACK should adhere to is making sure important behaviors can be recorded with as little taps as possible during class. The app should be able to be export data as either a PDF or an Excel sheet for convenience. </br></br>
