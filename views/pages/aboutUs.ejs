      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>Hello There! We are Track, a group of highly 
        motivated students from Purdue University. We are all 
        members of Purdue's Engineering Projects in Community 
        Service (EPICS) Track team. TRACK started as an idea for
         teachers to track behaviors in class, specifically 
         targeted at younger children. Because all teachers have an iPad, 
         we thought about repurposing an old team’s iOS application and 
         customizing it to fit the teacher’s needs. However, as we visited ISD 
         early in the semester, it became clear that many other teachers at the 
         school wanted the app as well, and that they would prefer the app as a web application. 
         We thus pivoted to a web application with a focus on storing student data from year to year
          to help teachers understand their students more thoroughly.</p>
      <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
      <p>ISD, the Indiana School for the Deaf, is a K-12 school for deaf children. 
        There are about 62 teachers there that all track their students’ progress 
        through Individualized Education Programs, or IEPs. Currently, teachers 
        track the IEP goals of their students on either Excel spreadsheets or 
        physically on clipboards during class. These general, overarching IEP goals are 
        created once a year at a conference, but the goals for each individual student varies. 
        There seems to be three main categories of IEP goals - behavior goals, like the number 
        of times the students should do something, i.e. Bob answered the question correctly 
        three out of five times this week; disciplinary “goals”, or easy ways for teachers to 
        timestamp bad behaviors students do and notice patterns; finally, descriptive goals, 
        which are open-ended notes that teachers will make of their students.</p>
      <h1>Our Goal</h1>
      <p>This app would be used by teachers, primarily on iPads, and would affect their 
        interactions with the students they teach. The problem that currently happens is 
        that it becomes difficult to teach, track, and timestamp behaviors students are 
        exhibiting while class is in session. TRACK aims to address all three of these issues 
        with an easy to use iPad application. The main goal that TRACK should adhere to is making 
        sure important behaviors can be recorded with as little taps as possible during class. 
        The app should be able to be export data as either a PDF or an Excel sheet for convenience.</p>
